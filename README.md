# MeltingPlot
### R script for strains clustering/typing and epidemiological investigation using High Resolution Melting (HRM) temperatures.

With MeltingPlot is possible to type pathogens and perform epidemiological investigations using High Resolution Melting (HRM) data. A graph-base algorithm was designed to discriminate pathogen clones starting from HRM temperaturs.

MeltingPlot can also merge HRM data with isolates and patients metadata to create graphical and tabular outputs useful in epidemiological studies. 

Read the manual https://skynet.unimi.it/wp-content/uploads/MeltingPlot/MeltingPlot_Manual.pdf to know better how to use it an to see some example of outputs

MelingPlot has also an online version available at https://skynet.unimi.it/index.php/tools/meltingplot/
